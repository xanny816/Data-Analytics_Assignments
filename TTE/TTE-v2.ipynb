    "\n",
    "- **Outcome Model with Clustering:** The coefficients indicate an intercept of about **0.02006**. The dummy variables for the clusters (e.g., `C(cluster)[T.1]` and `C(cluster)[T.2]`) have small positive coefficients (~0.00459 and ~0.00419, respectively), suggesting slight differences across clusters. The treatment effect is approximately **-0.01422** and the effect of `x2` is about **0.00581**.\n",

    "- **Marginal Structural Model (MSM):** The MSM coefficients with clustering are very similar to those of the outcome model. The treatment effect remains stable, and the follow-up time coefficient is nearly zero, which may indicate that the treatment effect does not vary with time over the follow-up period.\n",

    "\n",
    "The incorporation of clustering into the analysis helps capture underlying heterogeneity among patients. Although the cluster adjustments introduce small differences in the intercept, the estimated treatment effect remains similar to the model without clustering. This suggests that while there is some latent subgroup variability, the overall effect of treatment is robust. The MSM results reinforce this finding, indicating that the treatment effect is consistent over time."
